File executes as the group that owns the file not as the group of the user who executed the file.  2. Only effect executable binary files.  3. No effect on general files which are not binary executables such as scripts.  4. Indicated by “s/S” in the execute position of group owner permissions. | 1. Newly created files will inherit group of their parent directory.  2. Indicated by “s/S” in the execute position of group’s permissions.                   | 1. /usr/bin/wall  2. Used in collaboration when all the files are owned by different users of same group.  3. It can be used with sticky bit to create a collaborative directory where all files created by all the users have the same group ownership but the users can only write/modify their own files and all other users can read the files due to the common group ownership of files. |
