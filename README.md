# docs-linux-generic

1. This repository is meant to manage my own personal documentation about generic things related to Linux that are not related to any particular Linux distribution.

2. All the contents of this repository will be regularly updated with important information about related topics.

3. This will be an ongoing process as there is too much confusing and contradicting information and I will try my best to filter confusing and contradicting information and write only when I feel it is correct upto my knowledge. Althogh I will be constantly updating the documents as I will find minor mistakes or any confusing statements of mine.
